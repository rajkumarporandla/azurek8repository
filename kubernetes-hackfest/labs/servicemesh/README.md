# Lab: ServiceMesh Labs

According to William Morgan from Buoyant, a service mesh is a "A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer for handling service-to-service communication. Itâ€™s responsible for the reliable delivery of requests through the complex topology of services that comprise a modern, cloud native application."

This is an advanced topic. Service Mesh technology is not for every application and scenario, but when used properly, can be very powerful.
